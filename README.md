# Cantern
An interactive lantern constructed from an Arduino and a Monster Energy can.

To make the lantern, a can of Monster Energy was cut open from the bottom and an Arduino strip light component was glued onto the inside. The strip light component was connected to the Arduino, which was controlled by the code in this repo.
